# AI Agent Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a basic AI agent implementation created by following an online tutorial. The purpose of this project is to learn and understand core concepts behind AI agents, including reasoning loops, task execution, and tool usage.

This is a **learning-focused repository** and serves as a foundation for future, independently developed AI projects.

---

## Goals
- Understand the structure and workflow of an AI agent
- Learn how agents plan, reason, and execute actions
- Explore prompt design and basic tool integration
- Build a reference implementation for future extensions

---

## What This Project Includes
- A simple AI agent architecture
- Reasoning and action execution loop
- Basic task handling
- Experimentation with agent behavior

---

## Learning Approach
This project was built by:
- Following an online tutorial to learn foundational concepts
- Running and modifying the code to understand how each component works
- Experimenting with parameters and prompts to observe agent behavior

The focus is on **learning and comprehension**, not originality or production use.

---

## Future Plans
This repository will remain a learning and experimentation base.  
Future projects that extend these ideas into original applications will be developed in **separate repositories**.

Planned next steps include:
- Designing an agent for a real-world problem
- Adding constraints and evaluation metrics
- Improving transparency of agent reasoning

---

## Disclaimer
This project is based on tutorial material and is intended for educational purposes only.
